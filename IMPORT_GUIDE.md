# Importing via extension file

For importing via **file extension**,
it is noted that Microsoft MakeCode Arcade
can **import** code with embedded image files or
**machine files** such as HEX and UF2 files.

Which Phattisena has distributed
the UF2 file in this repo in case
you **import** it through the link but
it **doesn't show**.

This will have the following steps:

## check the repo and download

* If some **makecode arcade extensions** repositories are
  and come with UF2 or HEX files that have
  the word arcade in front of them,
  you can **download and import** them through this file.

## import extension with uf2 or hex file

* After downloading the UF2 file or HEX file in the repo
  go to the [arcade.makecode.com](https://www.arcade.makecode.com)
  And go to your **project** where you want to **import** the extension.
  After entering the project, try to add an **extension**.

1. When you enter the page to add an extension,
   try to **import** the extension via a link or extension ID.
   If the test does not show?

2. try importing the extension via a hex file or a UF2 file.
   After importing an extension with a hex file or a UF2 file,
   the **project** will check this file first
   After importing an extension with a hex file or a UF2 file,
  
3. the project will check this file first, if the imported file is complete,
   the project will allow the import,
   if the project detects that the imported extension file is incomplete.
   the project may not allow importing this file.
